# Vaadin TreeGrid add-on

TreeGrid is a UI component add-on for Vaadin 7. It adds the ability to display and edit hierarchical data source in the Grid component (similar to TreeTable's extension to Table).

https://vaadin.com/directory#!addon/vaadin-treegrid

## Getting started
[Live Demo â†—](http://adam.app.fi/treegrid)

Here is a simple example on how to try out the add-on component:

```java
import org.vaadin.treegrid.container.Measurable;
import com.vaadin.data.Collapsible;
// ...

public class DemoContainer extends HierarchicalContainer implements Collapsible, Measurable {
    // ...
}
```

```java
public class DemoUI extends UI {
    // ...

    @Override
    protected void init(VaadinRequest request) {
        final TreeGrid grid = new TreeGrid();

        DemoContainer container = new DemoContainer();
        grid.setContainerDataSource(container);

        grid.setHierarchyColumn(DemoContainer.NAME_PROPERTY);

        grid.setColumnReorderingAllowed(true);

        // ...
    }
}
```

For a more comprehensive example, see treegrid-demo/src/main/java/org/vaadin/treegrid/demo/DemoUI.java

## Building and running the add-on project

```
git clone https://github.com/vaadin/tree-grid
mvn clean install
cd treegrid-demo
mvn jetty:run
```

To see the demo, navigate to http://localhost:8080/

## Development with Eclipse IDE

For further development of this add-on, the following tool-chain is recommended:
- Eclipse IDE
- m2e wtp plug-in (install it from Eclipse Marketplace)
- Vaadin Eclipse plug-in (install it from Eclipse Marketplace)
- JRebel Eclipse plug-in (install it from Eclipse Marketplace)
- Chrome browser

### Importing project

Choose File > Import... > Existing Maven Projects

Note that Eclipse may give "Plugin execution not covered by lifecycle configuration" errors for pom.xml. Use "Permanently mark goal resources in pom.xml as ignored in Eclipse build" quick-fix to mark these errors as permanently ignored in your project. Do not worry, the project still works fine. 

### Debugging server-side

If you have not already compiled the widgetset, do it now by running vaadin:install Maven target for treegrid-root project.

If you have a JRebel license, it makes on the fly code changes faster. Just add JRebel nature to your treegrid-demo project by clicking project with right mouse button and choosing JRebel > Add JRebel Nature

To debug project and make code modifications on the fly in the server-side, right-click the treegrid-demo project and choose Debug As > Debug on Server. Navigate to http://localhost:8080/treegrid-demo/ to see the application.

### Debugging client-side

Debugging client side code in the treegrid-demo project:
  - run "mvn vaadin:run-codeserver" on a separate console while the application is running
  - activate Super Dev Mode in the debug window of the application or by adding ?superdevmode to the URL
  - You can access Java-sources and set breakpoints inside Chrome if you enable source maps from inspector settings.
